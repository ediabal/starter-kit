# Stencil Component Starter Kit Challenge

This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil.


# The Challenge

We'd like to challenge you to create a toggle component based on the provided design...

![toggle](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/how-to-build-a-custom-toggle-switch-with-react/1.png)

## Requirements

- You must fork this repository and supply a link to that fork.
- The component must support the ability to be enabled and disabled.
- The component must be visually styled to show its enabled and disabled states.
- An event must be emitted when the component changes.
- The component must be rendered in the `index.html` sample.

### Bonus (not required)

- Implement the checkbox component displayed in the design.


## Additional Stencil information below...

# Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool. Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Getting Started

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ediabal/starter-kit.git
cd starter-kit
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

Need help? Check out our docs [here](https://stenciljs.com/docs/my-first-component).

## Naming Components

When creating new component tags, we recommend _not_ using `stencil` in the component name (ex: `<stencil-datepicker>`). This is because the generated component has little to nothing to do with Stencil; it's just a web component!

Instead, use a prefix that fits your company or any name for a group of related components. For example, all of the Ionic generated web components use the prefix `ion`.
